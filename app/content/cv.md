### üíº Employment History

#### Soft Pauer (2025 - Current Day)

**Full Stack Software Engineer**

Full-stack software engineer specializing in AI-powered enterprise applications and cloud infrastructure. As the lead engineer, I drove the design, development, and deployment of a complex multi-agent AI system, taking it from initial concept to a fully operational, production-ready product. My key responsibilities and expertise included:

* **AI Agent System Development & Deployment**: Spearheaded the end-to-end development of a scalable multi-agent AI system, integrating advanced language models, sophisticated function calling, and comprehensive performance optimization strategies to deliver a robust enterprise solution.
* **Secure Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps**: Designed and deployed the entire Azure cloud environment, implementing a secure SDLC by integrating static code analysis (Bandit) and automated security checks directly into CI/CD pipelines. Established private networks and strict access controls to minimize the attack surface and ensure secure operational practices.
* **Application Security**: Developed core project functionalities with a security-first mindset, meticulously handling user inputs and implementing robust defenses against common vulnerabilities like Remote Code Execution (RCE) and SQL Injection.
* **Advanced AI Security**: Conducted in-depth security architecture reviews and threat modeling for the AI agent system, proactively addressing unique AI-specific risks such as prompt injection, sensitive data leakage, and denial-of-service scenarios, adhering to **OWASP Top 10 for LLMs** principles.
* **Security Monitoring & Compliance Readiness**: Implemented comprehensive logging, version control, and alerting systems to enhance visibility, support continuous monitoring, and contribute to overall compliance readiness.

Responsible for transforming business requirements into robust, scalable technical solutions while maintaining high code quality standards and security best practices.
